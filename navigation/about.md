# Culture and Family

**Born**: San Diego

**From**: India

Even though I was born here in San Diego, I am still very connected to my indian culture and regularly do traditional things as well as attending cultural events. I also did indian classical singing for 7 years. 

**Family**: My family consists on me, my dad, my mom, and my brother. I am the oldest in my family. My mom also owns an indian clothing store which I work at over the summer. Working there allows me to stay in touch with my culture while getting job experience. 

# Academics

Here at school I am also invested in my academics as I have taken 2 other APs and an honors class. My classes are related to my future asperations because I want to work in Biotechnology and am taking this class as well as Honors Medical Interventions. 

# Fun Facts 

**Favorite Things**: When I was younger, I was afraid of dogs but now I know that is because I love cats. I really want a bengal cat. My favorite american holiday is Halloween because I love sour candy and dressing up with my friends. 

**Hobbies**: In my freetime, I enjoy drawing, singing, and reading. Last year I took AP Studio Art because of my passion for art. 

**Here is some of my art**
