    "Q2: A small team of wildlife researchers is working on a project that uses motion-activated field cameras to capture images of animals at study sites. The team is considering using a “citizen science” approach to analyze the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following best explains why such an approach is considered useful for this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D\n",
    "- Citizen science involves members of the general public participating in scientific research. Distributing the image analysis work to a larger group of individuals allows the work to be completed in less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: An algorithm is intended to display the following output.\n",
    "\n",
    "red red blue red red blue red red blue\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following code segments can be used to display the intended output?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C,  For each iteration of the outer loop, \"red\" is displayed two times and then \"blue\" is displayed one time. The outer loop iterates three times, so \"red red blue\" is displayed three times as intended.\n",

    "Q6: The question below uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially in the bottom left square of the grid and facing right. The figure presents a robot in a grid of squares with 5 rows and 4 columns. The robot is represented by a triangle which is initially in the lower left square of the grid, facing right. The grid contains a gray square in the first row and third column of the grid. The following programs are each intended to move the robot to the gray square. Program II uses the procedure GoalReached, which returns true if the robot is in the gray square and returns false otherwise.\n",
    "Which of the following statements best describes the correctness of the programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C, Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward twice, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the bottom right corner of the grid, rotating left, moving the robot forward to the upper right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the gray square.\n",

    "Q19: Which of the following best describes the growth in the number of registered users for the first eight years of the application’s existence?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C, From years 1 to 5, the number of registered users roughly doubled each year. From years 5 to 8, the number of registered users increased by about 100 million each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q22: Which of the following code segments can be used to simulate the behavior of the spinner?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D, For this spinner, there is a chance of \"Lose a turn\", a chance of \"Move 2 spaces\", and a chance of \"Move 1 space\". The variable spin is set to a random value between 1 and 8. If spin is 1 (which occurs of the time), the code segment prints \"Lose a turn\". If spin is 2 (which occurs of the time), the code segment prints \"Move 2 spaces\". The remaining of the time, the code segment prints \"Move 1 space\".\n",

    "Q23: A flowchart is a way to visually represent an algorithm. The flowchart below is used by an application to set the Boolean variable available to true under certain conditions. The flowchart uses the Boolean variable weekday and the integer variable miles.\n",
    "Which of the following statements is equivalent to the algorithm in the flowchart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D, The flowchart sets available to true whenever weekday is true and miles is less than 20, and sets available to false otherwise. This code statement provides the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q24: Which of the following describes the result of executing the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D, The value of val starts at 0 and is repeatedly incremented by 2, so the program calculates the sum of even integers. Inside the loop, val is incremented by 2 before being added to sum, so the first value added to sum is 2. The loop iterates 10 times, adding each intermediate value of val each time. Therefore, the program displays the sum of the even integers starting at 2 and ending at 20.\n",

    "Q33: An administrator at the school has data about hundreds of students in a particular course. While the administrator does not know the values of each student’s individual assignment scores, the administrator does have the following information for each student.\n",

    "The number of assignments for the course\n",
    "The average assignment score before the lowest score was dropped\n",
    "The course grade after the lowest score was dropped\n",
    "Which of the following CANNOT be determined from this data alone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: A, Without knowing the individual assignment scores, the administrator is unable to determine any of the student’s individual scores other than the lowest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q37: Which of the following can be used to replace <MISSING CODE> so that the figure is drawn correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: A, The code segment draws four line segments, each with a left endpoint at the coordinate (2, 6). The first line segment has a right endpoint at the coordinate (8, 8). The loop repeatedly subtracts two from endY, so that the subsequent line segments have their right endpoints at (8, 6), (8, 4), and (8, 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q45: Which of the following code segments best simulates the behavior of the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: D, In this code segment, three coin flips are simulated, where one result is represented by 1 and the other result is represented by 0. The player wins when the sum of these is 0 or 3, indicating all heads or all tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q47: The procedure BinarySearch (numList, target) correctly implements a binary search algorithm on the list of numbers numList. The procedure returns an index where target occurs in numList, or -1 if target does not occur in numList. Which of the following conditions must be met in order for the procedure to work as intended?\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Answer: C, In order for a binary search on a list to work as intended, the list must be sorted.\n",

    "Correct Answers: C, The ability to have a larger number of perspectives reflected in the encyclopedia content D, The ability to quickly update encyclopedia content as new information becomes available\n",
    "- As any user has the ability to edit articles, there will be many opportunities for people with different perspectives to contribute.\n",

    "- The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list open bracket, 30, 40, 20, 10, close bracket, the procedure returns 2 0, which is not the least value in the list.\n",
