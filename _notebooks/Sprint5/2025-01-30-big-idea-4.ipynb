    "- 3. When we were creating our Big Ideas video that went over how our project met CPT requirements, I created a poster that discussed how the backend and frontend were related to each other as well as helping plan each part of the video. This helped me explain the backend to my teammates and helped give the team an idea of how our project met CPT requirements \n",
