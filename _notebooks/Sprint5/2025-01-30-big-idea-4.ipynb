Even though I understood deployment by the end of the process, I want to focus on improving on it during third tri. \n",

    "- Overall, I think our project is very visually appealing to look at and has three standout features that people enjoyed throughout night at the museum and in general. These are the posting feature, the random recipe generators, and the maps that locate different restaurants. The organization of our website into different countries makes it great for viewers to explore the themes and restaurants in each place and leave reviews. \n",
    "- However, many people have given us feedback that says to make the maps more interesting with different colors, and maybe add a different feature to Asia and South America.\n",
    "- For future plans, I think we will focus on developing the explore more page on Asia and South America, to create something new and further our understanding. \n",
