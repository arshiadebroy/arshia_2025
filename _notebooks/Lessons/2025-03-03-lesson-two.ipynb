    "## Ethical and Legal Concerns Notes \n",
    "- Digital media is regulated through copyright laws, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, legal measures, and more \n",
    "- A software license is a legal agreement that defines how others use your code and without a lisence, All Rights are reserved. \n",
    "- Open source and open source software is code that is publicly open to anyone and anyone can collaborate to the code. Though it is usually used with good intention, the open access can negatively affect the quality of the code. \n",
    "- MIT license and Apache 2.0 license which can be used by companies to protect there work and has patent protection for users of the license. Other licenses can be used for artists so that they can choose how others use there work\n",
    "- Big Tech Companies use certain licenses while non-profits use other licenses which best fit there purpose \n",
    "- Google vs. Oracle happened because Oracle sued Google for unfair api use and violating their licensing. Google claimed that they rightfully used the apis and code. \n",
    "- Things can be legal but very unethical because if there are no laws on AI models, then people can abuse it in unethical ways. This can hugely affect the future of CSP. "
