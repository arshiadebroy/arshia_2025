Through this I was able to increase my mcq scores during practice quizzes getting up to a 60/70 on the final mcq. This aided me in preparing for the csp exam and having a better understanding of different topics relating to coding. "

    "- Restaurant Reviews Project \n",
    "Designed and implemented a dynamic web application using SQLite to store user-submitted reviews and ratings. Built a clean and responsive frontend UI with JavaScript and HTML/CSS, enabling users to easily post, browse, and sort restaurant reviews. Leveraged Postman to test RESTful endpoints and integrated external APIs to enrich content.\n",

    "- Recipe Finder with API Integration \n",
    "Developed a full-stack restaurant and recipe finder using the Spoonacular API. Constructed a Flask-based backend that processed user input, made external API calls, and returned tailored recipe results. Collaborated with the frontend team to present results using an interactive, user-friendly layout. Used Postman for route testing and data validation. \n",

    "- Surviving Sickness: Predictive Health Model \n",
    "Created a logistic regression model in Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn to predict survival likelihood based on influenza symptoms. Integrated the model into a Flask API and built an intuitive frontend interface for real-time user input and prediction display. Demonstrated strong data science foundations and end-to-end model deployment skills.  \n",

    "## Personal Growth and Soft Skills \n",
    "- Through this course, I've learned how to work better with a team and grown as a person\n",
    "- Entering this class, I didn't know many people and I also didn't know how to code, which made the start rough. It was hard to run commands, work on Kasm, and work without knowing a lot of people. Through trimester 1 I ended up changing computers to try coding without Kasm and with it I also changed my attitude. I began to talk to more groups surrounding me and I met some of my now teammates for the first time. This strengthened my resolve and aided me in building new skills I hadn't before\n",
    "- Through lessons and live reviews I became familiar with a new style of grading and I prepared myself better through collaborating with my team and learning that working together results in the best outcomes. When in trimester 2 I was with a few teammates that didn't know how to code, I learned to help them learn the basics while holding up my team. This progressed my coding skills as well as made me better at running a team. \n",
    "- Throughout third trimester, I took more of a backseat but I figured out how to be in a team without overplaying my role. If I did my part and encouraged everyone to do theirs, we could come up with a better result. \n",
    "- Overall, I feel as though this course hasn't just progressed my knowledge of Computer Science, but also made me a better teammate and person. The things I have learned through this class I plan to use for the rest of my career and the people I have met have enriched my experiance here at Del Norte. "
