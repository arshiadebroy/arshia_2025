    "_-What?:_\n",
    "This is a feature that takes the qualities (Age and Sex) and the symptoms (Fever, Cough, Shortness of Breath, Chest Pain) of users and predicts survival. This was made using information in the Influenza symptoms and death cases. This is the **simplest feature** we have on our website since it was made **DIRECTLY** from the Titanic model provided; it just tweaked the data set and input options. This teaches users how to set up basic containers and input boxes. Yes/no intake for symptoms also requires less backend and frontend code, which makes it easier for users to understand the basic foundations of using machine learning in data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "_-Model:_\n",
    "Uses a **Logistic Regression**. This works with binary classification and can predict outputs when users input simple yes/no or true/false data. Since this is a disease tracking feature, yes/no questions can be used to ask if users are feeling a certain symptom, allowing the model to accurately predict survivability. \n",
    "\n",
    "_-Data Formats:_\n",
    "Uses **text and numeric data formatting**. The numeric data is used to input user age, and the text is what allows users to input either yes/no, depending on their symptoms. The output is also given in a textual format. \n",
    "\n",
    "_-Different Use Cases:_\n",
    "This feature can be used in **healthcare and education**. Since this is a disease survivability tracker, it has the potential to be adapted into a survey that patients can take to diagnose themselves with different diseases and their survivability. However, since this can be very risky, it is more applicable in an educational setting. This data is based on previous cases of diseases, so it can be used by medical students to study how different variables like age/ other symptoms affect survivability. \n",

It then outputs a specific country that suits the user's expectations. This was placed after the sickness model in difficulty, as it includes multiple drop-down menus that require more coding in both the frontend and backend. Data must be carefully crafted/found to satisfy each category, which can be harder to do. This is a slight step above the basic foundational Sickness Survivability. \n",

    "This takes inputs like GPA, SAT score, ACT score, AP class count, and extracurriculars to provide a UC that would best fit the user, as well as the user's predicted acceptance chance percentage. This was placed after the previous two features in terms of difficulty because of how it gives **two different types of outputs**. Prior to this, the output was either pure numerical or textual, but this shows how you can combine both. Because of the data analyzed in the backend, the frontend predicts which of the colleges best suits the percentage acceptance that is sent over through the API endpoint, and both the college and percentage are displayed. This further shows frontend/backend integration with data science. \n",

Based on these numbers, the model will predict the pet's happiness on a scale of 1-10 and display a progress bar with animation, change the image of the pet's facial expression, and display a speech bubble based on the pet's thoughts. This was placed after the previous features because not only does it have multiple outputs, it also has **different output formatting** (image, animation, and text). All of these outputs are based on the data analysis happiness result, which shows users how data science results can be used to display various types of outputs, not just pure text. \n",

    "This uses a slider bar and asks for the user's test score (MCQ and FRQ). Based on the data inputted, a graph will be displayed showing the user's score compared to other test takers as well as the predicted score result. The graph is not something that is static, but users can physically see it move/ change as they adjust the slider bar. Since this feature introduces how to **categorize and organize analyzed data in a graph structure**, this is considerably more difficult than previous features. The purpose of data science is to analyze data, and graphs are a huge part of that. This feature can teach users how to utilize graphs while maintaining simple textual outputs (the actual score itself). \n",
    "\n",
    "_-Model:_\n",
    "Uses a **Quantile Transformer**. This takes data and spreads it out into the graph that we see. It converts the raw test scores that users input into a percentage that can be used to compare scores with other test-takers and display them in a graph format. \n",

There is an option for users to publicly store their results, in which case the result is stored permanently on the website and allows others to view it. There is also a pie chart that is freshly created based on the predicted Titanic survivability score. This is by far the most impressive feature out of all the member created ones since it not only has multiple input options (like Surivability and movie), multiple types of outputs (like the Pet), a graph/ data display of some sort (like the score predictor), but it also can store the data predicted through the backend. This adds an extra layer to how data science can be used and displayed. \n",
